1. Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Avoid abbreviations
and overly generic names that may be confusing or misleading.
2. Write code that is easy to read and understand. Use consistent formatting,
spacing, and indentation to make the code more visually appealing.
3. Keep functions short and focused. Each function should have a single
responsibility and should be easy to understand at a glance.
4. Avoid unnecessary complexity. Simplify the code by removing any unnecessary
variables, functions, or logic.
5. Write code that is modular and reusable. Use functions and classes that can be
easily reused in other parts of the codebase.
